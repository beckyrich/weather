# Weather App

This is a weather app designed to demonstrate ability to make an API call, manipulating the DOM, and handing errors

## Thoughts After Project

- Going back later, when time permits, I would break the sections down into smaller components. This would make it more manageable and scalable.
- Instead of traditional CSS, I would implement TailwindCSS or Bootstrap

* Started researching adding a satellite view through Google Maps API to the weather app
* I would also create an .env file to make the API private as a best practice and security.

## Resources

- Stack Overflow- for researching async/await and promises while figuring out error handling. Also researching how to display icon with current weather
- CSS Tricks- for some styling ideas and a refresher of Flexbox
- Axios Documentation through Github
- OpenWeather API Documentation

* Google Maps API Documentation (for future features)
