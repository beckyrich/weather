# Weather App

This is a weather app designed to demonstrate API called, manipulating the DOM, handing errors, and showing creativity

## Thoughts After Project

- Going back later, when time permits, I would break the sections down into smaller components. This would make it more manageable and scalable.
- I would love to get the icon to work and sync with the current weather
- Instead of traditional CSS, I would implement TailwindCSS or Bootstrap
- Styling still needs to be formatted/aligned more effeciently
